# UNF PathFinder

## Recognition
This project was awarded 3rd place overall at the University of North Florida School of Computing Symposium.

## Purpose and description
Developed as the final project for Artificial Intelligence.  Practical implementation of A* search.  The app uses a set of persistance interconnected coordinates as the database which the A* algoirthm is based on.  Each coordinate node has multiple alias that could be referred to by the user.  After a user specifies an alias that he/she wants to search for, the Agent locates the starting node and then uses A* to trace it's way, following the optimal and complete path, to the source destination.  The app also estimates the walking time using mile distances obtained from the lat/lng difference between each point.

## Alogorithms utilized
A*

## API's Utilized
Google Maps
